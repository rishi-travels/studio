# **App Name**: AgriInsight

## Core Features:

- Yield Prediction: Predict crop yield based on historical data, weather patterns, and soil metrics using a machine learning model.
- Data Input: Allow farmers to input data about their crops, soil, and local conditions. Capture values for weather, temperature, humidity, and rainfall. Store them locally in the browser.
- Actionable Recommendations: Provide recommendations for irrigation, fertilization, and pest control, leveraging a tool that tailors its advice to the crop type, region, and predicted weather conditions.
- Historical Data Visualization: Display historical crop yield data and trends using charts and graphs.
- Weather Integration: Integrate with weather APIs to fetch real-time weather data and forecasts.
- Soil Health Metrics: Display soil health metrics using user input such as manual soil parameters.
